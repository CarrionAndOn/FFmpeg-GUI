# FFmpeg-GUI
 A simple GUI for FFmpeg written in Python.<br />
 I wrote this to try and learn python, I know there are plenty of FFmpeg GUIs out there.<br />

# Installation
For Windows, download the "ffmpeg-gui.exe" file in releases.<br />
<b>FFMPEG MUST BE INSTALLED. THIS DOES NOT COME WITH FFMPEG.</b><br />
<br />
For Ubuntu, download the "ffmpeg-gui" file in releases.<br />
If it does not run, try running `chmod +x ffmpeg-gui`<br />
If it still doesn't run, install python3-tk with `sudo apt install python3-tk`<br />
<b>AGAIN, FFMPEG IS STILL REQUIRED.</b><br />
The Ubuntu version should run on other Debian-based distributions just fine, but I have only tested it in Ubuntu.<br />
No idea if it runs on any other type of distribution like openSUSE.
