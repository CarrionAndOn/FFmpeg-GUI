# FFmpeg-GUI
 A simple GUI for FFmpeg written in Python.<br />
 I wrote this to try and learn python, I know there are plenty of FFmpeg GUIs out there.<br />
 
# Installation
For Windows, download the "ffmpeg-gui.exe" file in releases.
I am working on a Linux build, I just don't have the time to openSUSE right now.
